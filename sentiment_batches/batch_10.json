The technology has improved enormously, even in the last six to 12 months. The artificial intelligence that drives it means that images that appear to be blurred or partially obscured, which a year or two ago could not be matched, now can be matched.

That means that if there is evidence that can be followed up, such as CCTV footage, the police will always do that regardless of the value of the goods stolen. In the past six to 12 months, the artificial intelligence algorithm that enables facial matching has become a lot more sophisticated.

Noble Lords will find an unusual degree of confluence between what you might describe as the two ends of the media spectrum, in that I very much agree with the noble Lord, Lord Black, on the issues of artificial intelligence use and the digital giants’ use of material coming from mainstream and private publishers without declaring or making fair payment for that.
