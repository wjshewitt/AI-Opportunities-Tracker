    "contextText": "But out of the disappointed hopes of those two decades it was easy to construct a completely opposite future marked by the clash of civilisations, between the autocratic and the democratic powers, and fierce competition between the major nations of the world for control of artificial intelligence technology. In a way, far from wanting to join Europe, Russia was depicted as wanting to attack it and even to conquer it if given the chance.

For my part, I will not focus on any of the specific recommendations of the report, as I have great confidence that others have covered that ground.
