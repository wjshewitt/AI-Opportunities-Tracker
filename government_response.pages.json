    "text": "AI Opportunities Action Plan Government Response \n4 \n \nForeword by the Prime Minister \nArtificial Intelligence is the defining opportunity of our generation. It is not a technology that is \ncoming; a future revolution on the horizon. It is already here, materially changing lives – \npreventing illness in our NHS, creating exciting new companies in our economy, pushing the \nboundaries of scientific discovery in our universities. It will turbocharge every mission in this \nGovernment’s Plan for Change. And the potential for further innovation is vast. \nAI-powered scans can help doctors detect disease earlier. AI can cut NHS waiting lists by \nscheduling better appointments. It allows teachers to personalise their lessons to their \nchildren's needs. It can support small businesses with their record-keeping, spot potholes more \nquickly, and help speed up planning applications. Indeed, right across our public services, it \noffers frontline staff the precious gift of time. A chance to reconnect with the human, face-to-\nface aspects of their job, which I know is something that attracts so many people to public \nservice in the first place. \nIn short, in the coming years, there is barely an aspect of our society that will remain \nuntouched by this force of change. But this Government will not sit back passively and wait for \nchange to come. It is our responsibility to harness it and make it work for working people.  And \nit is our responsibility to make sure that Britain maintains its position as a world leader in AI, \neven as the competition increases. Some countries are going to make AI breakthroughs and \nexport them to the world. Other countries will be left to buy those breakthroughs by importing \nthem. This Action Plan sets out how Britain will be the former – a plan to make our country an \nAI superpower. \nWe start from a position of strength. This is the nation of Babbage, Turing and Lovelace – \ndriving change is in our DNA. Already, Britain is the third largest AI market in the world. We \nhave established a world-leading infrastructure for AI safety.  Vast resources of talent in our \nuniversities and scientific institutions. Numerous technology companies, operating at the AI \nfrontier, are proud to call our country home. And our values of democracy, open commerce \nand the rule of law are suited to the test of the times – crucial for the free exchange of ideas \nneeded to maximise AI’s potential. \nNonetheless, this race is speeding up and we must continue to move fast. Within days of our \nelection, we commissioned Matt Clifford CBE to develop this plan. Today, I am happy to \nendorse it and take the recommendations forward. Harnessing AI and using it to deliver our \nPlan for Change requires ambition, purpose and focus. This is a unique chance to boost \ngrowth, raise living standards, transform public services, create the companies of the future in \nBritain and deliver our Plan for Change. This Action Plan shows we are ready to take it. \nThe Rt Hon Keir Starmer KCB KC MP, Prime Minister  "

We will take forward the recommendation to expand our sovereign compute \ncapacity by at least 20x by 2030 – as compute needs grow, such expansion is critical if the UK \nis to keep pace. \nThe government will now start delivery of a new state of the art supercomputing facility that will \ndouble the capacity of our national AI Research Resource. DSIT will immediately start to \ndevelop the business case process and proceed to lock in a site and suppliers in 2025. UK \nresearchers and SMEs will be able to begin accessing the AI Research Resource in early \n2025, using the powerful supercomputers at Bristol (Isambard AI) and Cambridge (Dawn), \nenabling our best and brightest to make new discoveries and help drive economic growth. \nIn recognition of the importance of compute for scientific disciplines beyond AI, DSIT is also \nextending the UK’s leading scientific computing resource, Archer2, at Edinburgh University, \nuntil November 2026. This will ensure that our leading scientists have the resources they need.  \nThis investment in sovereign compute complements the more than £25 billion of private sector \ninvestment in new UK data centres announced since July.1 \nThe government will also work with stakeholders to develop a long-term compute strategy that \nwill ensure the UK has the AI infrastructure and compute capacity it needs to deliver new \nscientific innovations and discoveries that will drive productivity and growth throughout the \neconomy. The government will publish the Compute Strategy in Spring 2025. \nAI Growth Zones \nAs the Action Plan sets out, the UK must maximise opportunities to crowd in private sector \ninvestment and facilitate close government-industry collaboration. The government will create \nAI Growth Zones (AIGZs), areas with enhanced access to power and support for planning \napprovals, to accelerate the build out of AI infrastructure on UK soil. The government will \ndeliver the first AI Growth Zone at Culham, the headquarters of the UK Atomic Energy \nAuthority (UKAEA), subject to the agreement of a public-private partnership that delivers \n \n1 Department for Science Innovation and Technology, ‘Press Release: Tech Secretary welcomes foreign \ninvestment in UK data centres which will spur economic growth and AI innovation in Britain’, 2024 (Accessed 04 \nDecember 2024) "

The government and UKAEA will seek a private-sector partner who would \ndevelop one of the UK’s largest AI data centres, beginning with 100MW of capacity and with \nplans to scale up to 500MW. The pilot would pioneer innovative public-private models to \ndeliver secure, dedicated public sector computing capacity, supporting key national priorities. A \nprocess to identify a private sector partner will commence in Spring 2025, alongside steps to \nselect further AI Growth Zones. AIGZs have the potential to grow the AI sector to support AI \nadoption across the economy and enable the government to build new strategic partnerships \nwith leading AI players. They also have the potential to deliver local benefits, including job \ncreation, enhanced digital and energy infrastructure and sustainability initiatives.  \nAI Energy Council \nClean and renewable energy solutions are needed to power the increasing energy demands of \nAI. To identify potential solutions, the Science and Technology Secretary of State and the \nEnergy Secretary will co-chair a new AI Energy Council formed of industry leaders from the \nenergy and AI sectors. The Energy Council will provide expert insight on the energy needs of \nAI, opportunities to accelerate investment in the development of renewable and innovative \nenergy solutions, including Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) and the role of AI in a modern, \nefficient and sustainable energy system. \nNational Data Library \nTo make new advances in AI that benefit our society we need to ensure researchers and \ninnovators have access to new data. We will responsibly, securely and ethically unlock the \nvalue of public sector data assets to support AI research and innovation through the creation of \nthe National Data Library and the government’s wider data access policy. Both will be \nunderpinned by strong privacy-preserving safeguards. The government will set out further \ndetails on the National Data Library in due course. \nAI Skills and Talent \nCreating a strong talent pipeline and ensuring we address wider skills demands will be critical \nto realising our AI ambitions. Prestigious scholarship and fellowship programmes have an \nimportant role to play, alongside broader efforts to drive greater diversity across the AI talent \npool. The creation of Skills England and the Curriculum and Assessment Review will also \nenable us to upskill the existing workforce as well as teach young people the key skills they \nneed to succeed in the future. DSIT will work with DfE, DBT and UKRI to take forward the \nrecommendations designed to attract and support top talent and ensure we continue to train \nworld-class AI experts. \nRegulation \nEnsuring we have the right regulatory regime that addresses risks and actively supports \ninnovation will drive AI trust and adoption across the economy. The government will set out its \napproach on AI regulation and will act to ensure that we have a competitive copyright regime \nthat supports both our AI sector and the creative industries. "

To transform our public services with AI and encourage the private sector to \nstimulate growth through AI adoption, we will take forward Matt Clifford’s recommendations on \nadoption, including to employ a flexible ‘Scan, Pilot, Scale’ approach to adoption of AI across \nour public services. We intend to accept these recommendations in full and start by prioritising \nthe scaling up of successful pilots that adopt AI in the public interest, such as Caddy, led by the \nIncubator for AI. \nGovernment will appoint AI Champions in particular sectors highlighted in the Industrial \nStrategy. DSIT will also work with devolved and local government to identify AI adoption \nopportunities to drive growth.  \nSecure our future with homegrown AI \nThe Action Plan highlights how quickly AI has advanced. A small number of companies at the \nfrontier of AI are set to wield outsized global influence. The UK has a window of opportunity to \nsecure a stake, strengthening our global leadership in AI, protecting our economic security and \npositioning UK citizens to benefit. \nTo seize this opportunity, the government will launch a new function with the mandate to \nstrengthen the UK’s sovereign AI capabilities by supporting national champions at the frontier \nof AI. The function will operate with agility and draw on wider government functions to partner \nwith AI companies, including by:  \n• Leveraging AI Growth Zones to support partnered companies and ensuring that new \ncompute capacity is utilised strategically. \n• Exploring making available high-potential data sets for partnered companies, in \ncoordination with the National Data Library. \n• Supporting top AI talent to relocate to the UK to work with UK-based partnered \ncompanies. \n• Helping to build relationships between partnered AI companies and the UK’s national \nsecurity community. \nAchieving this ambitious mandate will require an agile team with leading industry expertise. \nThe government will provide further details by Spring 2025. \nNext steps \nThe government will continue to develop its policy response to the Action Plan as part of the \nbroader work ahead of the Spring 2025 Spending Review.
