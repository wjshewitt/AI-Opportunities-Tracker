        "content": "AI Opportunities Action Plan \n4 \nForeword by the Secretary of State for \nScience, Innovation and Technology \nToday, Britain is the third largest AI market in the world. We are home to an extraordinary array \nof global talent and pioneering AI firms like Google DeepMind, ARM, and Wayve. But despite \nour record of scientific discovery – from Alan Turing on algorithms and general-purpose \ncomputing to Tim Berners-Lee’s World Wide Web – the UK risks falling behind the advances in \nArtificial Intelligence made in the USA and China.   \nIn this next phase of AI development, we want Britain to step up; to shape the AI revolution \nrather than wait to see how it shapes us. Because we believe Britain has a particular \nresponsibility to provide global leadership in fairly and effectively seizing the opportunities of \nAI, as we have done on AI safety. That is why one of my first acts as Secretary of State was to \ncommission Matt Clifford to devise an AI Opportunities Action Plan for the British government.  \nThis plan shows how we can shape the application of AI within a modern social market \neconomy. We will do so by working closely with the world’s leading AI companies, Britain’s \nworld leading academics and entrepreneurs, and those talented individuals keen to start-up \nand scale-up their businesses here. Our ambition is to shape the AI revolution on principles of \nshared economic prosperity, improved public services and increased personal opportunities so \nthat:  \n• AI drives the economic growth on which the prosperity of our people and the \nperformance of our public services depend;  \n• AI directly benefits working people by improving health care and education and how \ncitizens interact with their government; and   \n• the increasing of prevalence of AI in people’s working lives opens up new opportunities \nrather than just threatens traditional patterns of work.   \nAcross government, we have already taken decisive action to support the AI sector and take \ndown the barriers to growth. Our transformative planning reforms will make it easier to build the \ndata centres that are the engines of the AI age. Skills England will help ensure that British \npeople are prepared for jobs in the AI-powered industries of tomorrow. The Digital Centre of \nGovernment I have created in my Department will drive forward the technological \ntransformation of the state, ensuring that public services offer citizens the same seamless \nexperience they can find in the private sector. \nThe recommendations in this plan are unapologetic in their ambition; Government must be the \nsame. Delivering our AI vision for Britain requires lots of hard work, some tough choices, and a \ncommitment to real partnership between public and private sectors. There’s no time to waste. \nToday, we have set out how we will rise to the challenge.  \nThe Rt Hon Peter Kyle MP, Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology"

If this continues, artificial intelligence \n(AI) could be the government’s single biggest lever to deliver its five missions, especially the \ngoal of kickstarting broad-based economic growth. It is hard to imagine how we will meet the \nambition for highest sustained growth in the G7 – and the countless quality-of-life benefits that \nflow from that – without embracing the opportunities of AI. \nAny national AI plan needs to be founded on a realistic assessment of the country’s strengths \nand weaknesses. Fortunately, the UK has solid – and in places genuinely world-leading – \nfoundations on which to build: \n• Strong fundamental AI research, and high-quality research and engineering talent \ncoming out of our universities, which are some of the best in the world for AI. \n• A vibrant startup and scaleup scene, with an increasingly skilled and experienced \nentrepreneurial workforce and growing quantities of sophisticated capital available for \nambitious companies. \n• Leading frontier AI companies in London, including Google DeepMind’s headquarters, \nsignificant OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft and Meta AI offices, as well as emerging local \nwinners – such as Wayve, the autonomous vehicle company. \n• Global leadership on AI safety and governance via the AI Safety Institute, and a \nproportionate, flexible regulatory approach. \nThese are all crucial prerequisites to making the most of AI opportunities; without them, the \nambition in this plan would not be credible. However, we cannot be complacent: to remain a \nworld leader we need to lead in both building and using AI. Our goal should be a thriving \ndomestic AI ecosystem, with serious players at multiple layers of the “AI stack” and widespread \nuse of AI products and services across the economy. \nThe UK’s starting point makes this aspiration plausible, but achieving it will require bold and \nvisionary action. The government must:  \n• Invest in the foundations of AI: We need world-class computing and data \ninfrastructure, access to talent and regulation (Section 1). \n• Push hard on cross-economy AI adoption: The public sector should rapidly pilot and \nscale AI products and services and encourage the private sector to do the same. This \nwill drive better experiences and outcomes for citizens and boost productivity (Section \n2). \n• Position the UK to be an AI maker, not an AI taker: As the technology becomes more \npowerful, we should be the best state partner to those building frontier AI. The UK \nshould aim to have true national champions at critical layers of the AI stack so that the \nUK benefits economically from AI advancement and has influence on future AI’s values, \nsafety and governance (Section 3)."

        "content": "AI Opportunities Action Plan \n6 \nThis Action Plan is made up of three sections – one for each of these goals. There are detailed \nrecommendations in each. In making them, I have tried to draw consistently on a small number \nof core principles:  \n• Be on the side of innovators: In every element of the Action Plan, the government \nshould ask itself: does this benefit people and organisations trying to do new and \nambitious things in the UK? If not, we will fail to meet our potential. \n• Invest in becoming a great customer: Government purchasing power can be a huge \nlever for improving public services, shaping new markets in AI, and boosting the \ndomestic ecosystem. But doing this well is not easy – it will require real leadership and \nradical change, especially in procurement. \n• Crowd in capital and talent: The UK is a medium-sized country with a tight fiscal \nsituation. We need the best talent around the world to want to start and scale \ncompanies here. If we do that, the best investors globally will want to deploy capital here \n– both into our startups and our AI infrastructure.  \n• Build on UK strengths and catalytic emerging areas: The UK has strong companies in \nthe AI application and integration layers that are well positioned to grow. We also have \nemerging areas of research and engineering strength – particularly in AI for science and \nrobotics – that could have a transformational impact across the economy, advance AI \nand unlock further innovation.  \nNo one can say with certainty what AI will look like a decade from now. My judgement is that \nexperts, on balance, expect rapid progress to continue. The risks from underinvesting and \nunderpreparing, though, seem much greater than the risks from the opposite. Even if AI \nprogress slows, we will see large benefits from deploying today’s frontier capabilities and \ninvesting in our infrastructure and talent base.  \nIf, however, capabilities continue to advance, having a stake in – and being the natural home \nof – advanced AI could be the difference between shaping the future of science, technology \nand work, or instead seeing these decisions made entirely outside our borders. This is a crucial \nasymmetric bet – and one the UK can and must make."

Lay the foundations to enable AI \n1.1 Building sufficient, secure and sustainable AI infrastructure \nThe foundation of the last decade of AI progress has been an extraordinary and sustained \ninvestment in computational power (often called “compute”). AI requires data centres that \nhouse the large and complex computers that are used to train AI models and to run ‘inference’ \n(where AI is used to complete tasks and answer queries). \nOf course, the UK does not need to own or operate all the compute it will need. Indeed, only a \nsmall fraction of our needs will be through such compute (though this fraction is important). A \ndecade from now the economy will almost certainly be more computationally intensive: new \nhigh-skill jobs and compute-adjacent industries will have been created and access to compute \nwill be a key pillar of economic security. Countries that enable the build out of AI infrastructure \nwill reap benefits through increased economic growth, the reinvigoration of former industrial \nsites and ownership of critical strategic assets.  \nThe availability of powerful computing resources sends an important signal to academic, \ntechnical and entrepreneurial talent and is a critical ingredient of innovation. We should expect \nenormous improvements in computation over the next decade, both in research and \ndeployment. Having this “learning by doing” happen in the UK is crucial if we want the \nindustries of the future to be built here. \nThe government must therefore secure access to a sufficient supply of compute. There is no \nprecise mechanism to allocate the proportions, but it should consist of:  \n• Sovereign AI compute, owned and/or allocated by the public sector, will enable the UK \nto quickly and independently allocate compute to national priorities. For example, we \nneed the ability to: drive mission-focused AI research; empower academics and startups \nto train AI models; and ensure access to AI compute for critical services in times of \nmarket disruption. Sovereign AI compute will almost certainly be the smallest \ncomponent of the UK’s overall compute portfolio. NB: this review has not considered the \nrequirements of non-AI high-performance computing, for which there is already a well-\nestablished case, including the need to deliver an exascale capability. Government \nshould seek to resolve this as soon as possible, noting that these systems will play a \ncrucial role in supporting AI science and research.  \n• Domestic compute, that is based within the UK but privately owned and operated and \nthat will position the UK as a leading AI economy and ensure the UK’s economic \nsecurity. Due to the criticality of compute for AI, domestic compute will create spillover \nbenefits in the form of jobs, investment and new, AI based, service businesses. In this \npart of the portfolio, crowding in private and international capital is critical. \n• International compute, accessed via reciprocal agreements and partnerships with like-\nminded partners, to give the UK access to complementary capabilities and facilitate joint"

We should proactively develop these \npartnerships, while also taking an active role in the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking.  \nTo achieve this, government should: \n1. Set out, within six months, a long-term plan for the UK’s AI infrastructure needs, \nbacked by a 10-year investment commitment. Building a world class AI compute \necosystem requires a clear objective and long-term capability and expertise. \nGovernment should consider what the most appropriate delivery body is for large scale \nresearch infrastructure that is delivered in partnership with universities and industry. We \nhave pockets of deep academic expertise in this space, such as at Edinburgh, Bristol \nand Cambridge universities, and we should draw on this. A credible plan will consider \nemerging compute technologies, include investment in software, skills, and wider high-\nperformance computing capabilities to complement our AI compute and enable AI for \nscience. \n2. Expand the capacity of the AI Research Resource (AIRR) by at least 20x by 2030 – \nstarting within 6 months. The AIRR should evolve into a set of mission-oriented \nclusters that bring together compute, data, and talent to pursue frontier AI research and \nother national priorities. Expansion by at least 20x by 2030 would ensure the AIRR \nenables the training of multiple AI models a year and provides an up to date research \ncapability.1 Given trends in hardware performance, this would not mean a 20x increase \nin investment if the government procures smartly.2 Such expansion is needed to keep \nup with the expected increases in computing power that we should assume will be \nneeded for AI workloads. This is unlikely to slow down; we need to “run to stand still”. As \npart of this, government should ensure that the public compute ecosystem hosts a \nrange of hardware providers to avoid vendor lock-in and ensure value for money.  \n3. Strategically allocate sovereign compute by appointing mission-focused “AIRR \nprogramme directors” with significant autonomy. These could be modelled after the \nDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) or the Advanced Research and \nInvention Agency (ARIA) to quickly and independently provide large amounts of \ncompute to high-potential projects of national importance, operating in a way that is \nstrategic and mission driven. Allocation is an essential part of any compute strategy: \nspreading large amounts of compute thinly will have little impact. We will have to make \nchoices about when to subsidise compute and when to provide it at cost, recognising \nthat this could form part of an attractive offer to entrepreneurs and researchers deciding \nwhere to base themselves. \n4. Establish ‘AI Growth Zones’ (AIGZs) to facilitate the accelerated build out of AI \ndata centres. As AI infrastructure providers seek access to land and power, \ngovernments who move quickly and mirror the pace of growth and innovation in the AI \ndata centre market will be best placed to secure investment. AIGZs could introduce a \n \n1 Assumes compute requirements continue to grow at 4x per year. \n2 Assuming trends in hardware performance continue, by 2030 each pound spent on GPUs will buy 8x more \nFLOP and require 4x less power, therefore expanding AIRR by 20x would require much less than a 20x increase \nin investment."

Government can also use AIGZs to drive local rejuvenation, \nchannelling investment into areas with existing energy capacity such as post-industrial \ntowns and coastal Scotland. Government should quickly nominate at least one AIGZ \nand work with local regions to secure buy-in for further AIGZs that contribute to local \nneeds. Existing government sites could be prioritised as pilots, including Culham \nScience Centre, the UK Atomic Energy Authority’s headquarters, which has access to \nsignificant power and land. Alongside this, government should consider other measures \nto accelerate buildout of data centres, such as offering central guidance, creating a \nbespoke planning use-class and considering the case for AI data centres to be eligible \nfor relevant relief schemes that incentivise private sector investment.   \n5. Mitigate the sustainability and security risks of AI infrastructure, while positioning \nthe UK to take advantage of opportunities to provide solutions. This should focus \nboth on secure private-sector compute as well as collaboration with the UK Intelligence \nCommunity. Government should also explore ways to support novel approaches to \ncompute hardware and, where appropriate, create partitions in national supercomputers \nto support new and innovative hardware. In doing so, government should look to \nsupport and partner with UK companies who can demonstrate performance, \nsustainability or security advancements.  \n6. Agree international compute partnerships with like-minded countries to increase \nthe types of compute capability available to researchers and catalyse research \ncollaborations. This should focus on building arrangements with key allies, as well as \nexpanding collaboration with existing partners like the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking. \n1.2 Unlocking data assets in the public and private sector \nTo fuel both frontier AI progress and high-quality AI applications, developers need access to \nhigh-quality data - the lifeblood of modern AI. Data that isn't in the training sets of current \nmodels and encodes new insights about the world is particularly valuable. Public data sets, \nincluding scientific data sets, may be extremely important in this context.  \nWe should seek to responsibly unlock both public and private data sets to enable innovation by \nUK startups and researchers and to attract international talent and capital. As part of this, \ngovernment needs to develop a more sophisticated understanding of the value of the data it \nholds, how this value can be responsibly realised, and how to ensure the preservation of public \ntrust across all its work to unlock its data assets. \nThe creation of the National Data Library (NDL) presents an enormous opportunity. As it \ndevelops the NDL, the government should: \n7. Rapidly identify at least five high-impact public data sets it will seek to make \navailable to AI researchers and innovators.

We should explore use of synthetic \ndata generation techniques to construct privacy-preserving versions of highly sensitive \ndata sets. Government data sets are a public asset, and careful consideration should be \ngiven to their valuation. \n8. Strategically shape what data is collected, rather than just making data available \nthat already exists. Government should look to collect data in strategically significant \nareas, building on existing UK strengths. For example, the NDL could build on the \nachievements of the UK Biobank to enhance research in areas such as disease \nrecognition and the prediction of health outcomes. The NDL should run open calls to \nreceive proposals from researchers and industry to propose new data sets. \n9. Develop and publish guidelines and best practices for releasing open government \ndata sets that can be used for AI, including on the development of effective data \nstructures and data dissemination methods. \n10. Couple compute allocation with access to proprietary data sets as part of an \nattractive offer to researchers and start-ups choosing to establish themselves in the UK \nand to unlock innovation. \n11. Build public sector data collection infrastructure and finance the creation of new \nhigh-value data sets that meet public sector, academia and startup needs. \nGovernment should identify how public data will be collected and its quality enhanced, \nincluding the use of AI-driven data cleansing tools to curate data sets stored across \ngovernment, making them suitable for AI developers and researchers.  \n12. Actively incentivise and reward researchers and industry to curate and unlock \nprivate data sets. In particular, the NDL should engage with UKRI to identify how the \ncreation of valuable high-quality data sets that support the research community could be \nbetter acknowledged via the Research Excellence Framework. Government should also \nexplore how to shape the market in data set curation, including contributions from the \nprivate sector. \n13.

Accurately assess the size of the skills gap. Current estimates are imprecise and \noutdated; the last government-funded AI labour market survey was in 2020 and the Unit \nfor Future Skills’ jobs and skills dashboard, while a step in the right direction, still uses \nsupply data from 2019.6 The success of the following recommendations depends on \naccurately understanding the skills gap, and so government must make efforts to come \nto a concrete and up-to-date number. \nOnce the size of the skills gap is confirmed, to reach this target over the next five years \ngovernment should: \n15. Support Higher Education Institutions to increase the numbers of AI graduates \nand teach industry-relevant skills. In 2022, 46,000 students graduated from an AI-\nrelevant higher education programme in the UK. While this is the highest in Europe, with \nGermany (32,000) second, the UK is behind Finland and others on a per capita basis \nand there remains unmet demand for skilled workers.7 Supporting universities to \ndevelop new courses co-designed with industry – such as the successful co-operative \neducation model of Canada's University of Waterloo, CDTM at the Technical University \nof Munich or France's CIFRE PhD model – and increasing their teaching and \nrecruitment capacity would help train the tens of thousands of AI professionals needed \nby 2030. \n16. Increase the diversity of the talent pool. Only 22% of people working in AI and data \nscience are women.8 Achieving parity would mean thousands of additional workers. The \nAI conversion courses have helped to diversify the AI pipeline, but only at the top end. \nGovernment should build on this investment and promote diversity throughout the \neducation pipeline.

Launch a flagship undergraduate and master’s AI scholarship programme on the \nscale of Rhodes, Marshall or Fulbright for students to study in the UK. Open to a \ndiverse initial cohort of 100 scholars from the UK and abroad, the programme would \ncombine financial support, cohort building, industry co-investment, and placements in \ngovernment or private sector AI organisations.

AI should become core to how we think about delivering services, \ntransforming citizens' experiences, and improving productivity. As well as strengthening the \nfoundations - data, skills, talent, IP, and assurance measures set out above - government \nshould also focus on its role as a major user and customer of AI and how it uses its powers to \ncatalyse private sector adoption: \n \nThough we are still early in the development of the AI application layer – and all AI use should \nbe tailored appropriately to the specific setting or sector in which it will be deployed. For \nexample, AI use in health and care will raise different considerations than in advanced \nmanufacturing. Indeed there are already great examples of AI use-cases driving tangible \nbenefits across the private and public sectors: \n• Using AI assistants to do repetitive tasks better and faster, freeing up to 20% of an \nemployee’s time.15 For example, it is helping some teachers cut down the 15+ hours a \nweek they spend on lesson planning and marking in pilots.   \n• Drafting structured reports and forms with AI can cut final document production \ntimes by 20-80% in professional services.16 Trials are underway exploring how these \nmethods can save time for clinical practitioners in the NHS.  \n• Automated threat and anomaly detection is already being responsibly deployed by \npolice forces across the country and used to clean up social media. \n• Assessment and diagnosis can be improved through the use of AI. For example, \nthrough the £21m AI Diagnostics fund, DHSC is supporting the deployment of \ntechnologies in key, high-demand areas such as chest X-Ray and chest CT scans to \nenable faster diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer in over half of acute trusts in \nEngland.

This will require: \n34. Consistent use of a framework for how to source AI – whether to build in-house, \nbuy, or run innovation challenges – that evolves over time, given data, capability, \nindustry contexts and evaluation of what’s worked.

Secure our future with homegrown AI \nBy the end of the decade, having national champions at the frontier of AI capabilities may be a \ncritical pillar of our national and economic security. Government should use the full powers it \nhas available to ensure this happens. \nAI systems are increasingly matching or surpassing humans across a range of tasks. Today’s \nAI systems have many limitations, but industry is investing at a scale that assumes capabilities \nwill continue to grow rapidly. Frontier models in 2024 are trained with 10,000x more computing \npower than in 2019, and we are likely to see a similar rate of growth by 2029. If progress \ncontinues at the rate of the last five years, by 2029 we can expect AI to be a dominant factor in \neconomic performance and national security. \nMany of us have become familiar with the remarkable capabilities of large language models \nacross a broad set of domains. Leading AI companies continue to push this frontier, and we \nare also seeing stunning progress in other modalities, including breakthroughs in video and \nimage generation, robotics, mathematics, and scientific discovery. To take one example, \nDeepMind’s AlphaFold – which predicts protein structures – is estimated to have saved the \nequivalent of 400 million years of researcher time. We can imagine the impact on science, \nmedicine and the broader economy if we see this sort of success in other domains.  \nGiven the pace of progress, we will also very soon see agentic systems – systems that can be \ngiven an objective, then reason, plan and act to achieve it. The chatbots we are all familiar with \nare just an early glimpse as to what is possible.  \nThe economic consequences of continued progress in these areas could be enormous. Just as \nwith previous technological revolutions, the people and countries who make decisions about \nhow these systems operate and what values they reflect – including their approach to safety – \nwill have huge influence over our lives.  \nIf this is to benefit the UK we must be an AI maker, not just an AI taker: we need companies \nat the frontier that will be our UK national champions. \nWe have all the raw ingredients to make this possible. AI research and product development is \na UK strength rooted in world-class engineering talent coming out of our excellent universities \nand local AI winners such as DeepMind and Wayve.

If we \naspire to be one of the biggest winners from AI and drive national renewal, we need to go \nfurther. \nGiven the lead the current frontier firms enjoy, we cannot expect the market to solely \nunderwrite a new challenger, especially in the next two to three years. But government holds \ncritical levers for the next stage of AI development. Generating national champions will require \na more activist approach and something more akin to Japan’s MITI or Singapore’s Economic \nDevelopment Board in the 1960s, not the “invisible hand”. \nThe government must maximise its ambition and ensure the UK has national champions at the \nfrontier of economically and strategically important capabilities. This means government needs \nto: \n• Ensure that research and development of frontier AI capabilities takes place in the UK – \nboth in the current foundation model paradigm and in emerging spaces such as AI for \nscience, robotics, and “embodied AI”.  \n• Ensure that the UK maximises both its economic upside from and influence on these \ncapabilities as they advance. \nAchieving this will require bold, concerted and coherent action, using all the levers of the state \nto make the UK the best place in the world to build and scale frontier AI companies. While I \ndon’t want to understate how difficult this will be, I am confident that with the right focus and \nbacking, the UK can do this.  \nTo this end, the government should: \n50. Create a new unit, UK Sovereign AI, with the power to partner with the private \nsector to deliver the clear mandate of maximising the UK’s stake in frontier AI. \nPublic-private collaboration will be at the heart of this unit. It will support the private and \nacademic sectors in doing what they do best, with the ability to collaborate internationally, \ncreate joint ventures, as well as invest in, incubate and spin out AI companies – refining its \nstrategy and approach as the technology matures. \nTo achieve this, the unit must develop a clear position on which areas of AI research are \nstrategically important for the future of the technology and make concentrated bets in these \nareas. This could involve supporting entrepreneurs to create new companies, backing startups \nto scale or partnering with existing AI companies that are already at the frontier to maximise \nthe UK’s upside however the technology develops.  \nWith a clear and powerful mandate the unit will play a critical coordinating role, able to remove \nbarriers and make deals to maximise the UK’s chance of growing globally competitive national \nchampions. It will need to be able to draw on the resources of government to act quickly and \ndecisively.

It is not a technology that is \ncoming; a future revolution on the horizon. It is already here, materially changing lives – \npreventing illness in our NHS, creating exciting new companies in our economy, pushing the \nboundaries of scientific discovery in our universities. It will turbocharge every mission in this \nGovernment’s Plan for Change. And the potential for further innovation is vast. \nAI-powered scans can help doctors detect disease earlier. AI can cut NHS waiting lists by \nscheduling better appointments. It allows teachers to personalise their lessons to their \nchildren's needs. It can support small businesses with their record-keeping, spot potholes more \nquickly, and help speed up planning applications. Indeed, right across our public services, it \noffers frontline staff the precious gift of time. A chance to reconnect with the human, face-to-\nface aspects of their job, which I know is something that attracts so many people to public \nservice in the first place. \nIn short, in the coming years, there is barely an aspect of our society that will remain \nuntouched by this force of change. But this Government will not sit back passively and wait for \nchange to come. It is our responsibility to harness it and make it work for working people.  And \nit is our responsibility to make sure that Britain maintains its position as a world leader in AI, \neven as the competition increases. Some countries are going to make AI breakthroughs and \nexport them to the world. Other countries will be left to buy those breakthroughs by importing \nthem. This Action Plan sets out how Britain will be the former – a plan to make our country an \nAI superpower. \nWe start from a position of strength. This is the nation of Babbage, Turing and Lovelace – \ndriving change is in our DNA. Already, Britain is the third largest AI market in the world. We \nhave established a world-leading infrastructure for AI safety.  Vast resources of talent in our \nuniversities and scientific institutions. Numerous technology companies, operating at the AI \nfrontier, are proud to call our country home. And our values of democracy, open commerce \nand the rule of law are suited to the test of the times – crucial for the free exchange of ideas \nneeded to maximise AI’s potential. \nNonetheless, this race is speeding up and we must continue to move fast. Within days of our \nelection, we commissioned Matt Clifford CBE to develop this plan. Today, I am happy to \nendorse it and take the recommendations forward. Harnessing AI and using it to deliver our \nPlan for Change requires ambition, purpose and focus. This is a unique chance to boost \ngrowth, raise living standards, transform public services, create the companies of the future in \nBritain and deliver our Plan for Change. This Action Plan shows we are ready to take it. \nThe Rt Hon Keir Starmer KCB KC MP, Prime Minister"
